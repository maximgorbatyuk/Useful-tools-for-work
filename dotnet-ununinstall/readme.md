# .NET Uninstaller for macOS

A bash script that completely removes .NET SDK and Runtime from macOS systems.

## Scripts inside:

- `dotnet-uninstall-pkgs.sh` - Removes .NET packages from the system. Was found by some time ago in the Internet by author.
- `dotnet-ununistall-by-claude.sh` - The script generated by Claude 4.5 Sonnet with some improvements. Author did not test it.

## What it does

This script performs a full cleanup of .NET installations on macOS by:

1. **Removing package receipts** - Clears .NET entries from the macOS installer database
2. **Deleting installation files** - Removes `/usr/local/share/dotnet` directory
3. **Cleaning up PATH** - Removes `/etc/paths.d/dotnet` configuration

## Components removed

|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Package receipts | macOS pkgutil database | All `com.microsoft.dotnet.*` entries |
| Installation files | `/usr/local/share/dotnet` | SDKs, runtimes, tools |
| PATH configuration | `/etc/paths.d/dotnet` | System-wide `dotnet` command access |
