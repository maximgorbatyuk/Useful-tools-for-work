# Git Branch Cleanup

A bash script for macOS/Linux that automatically cleans up merged Git branches from both local and remote repositories. It was generated by Claude 4.5 Sonnet.

## What it does

This script identifies and deletes branches that have already been merged into your protected branches (e.g., `main`, `development`, `production`). It helps keep your repository clean by removing stale feature branches that are no longer needed.

### Branch handling logic

| Branch Status | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| **Merged** into protected branch | ✂️ Delete (safe to remove) |
| **Unmerged** | ✅ Keep (work in progress) |
| **Protected** (`main`, `development`, etc.) | 🔒 Always keep |

## Features

- 🔍 Analyzes **all remote branches**, not just local ones
- 🛡️ Protects important branches (`development`, `sandbox`, `production`, `main`, `master`)
- 🧹 Cleans up both remote and local copies of merged branches
- ✅ Interactive confirmation before deletion
- 🎨 Color-coded output for easy reading
- 📊 Summary of branch statistics

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/git-branch-cleanup.git

# Make the script executable
chmod +x git-cleanup.sh

# Optionally, move to your PATH for global access
cp git-cleanup.sh /usr/local/bin/git-cleanup
```

## Usage

Navigate to any Git repository and run:
```bash
./git-cleanup.sh
```

Or if installed globally:
```bash
git-cleanup
```

## Example Output
